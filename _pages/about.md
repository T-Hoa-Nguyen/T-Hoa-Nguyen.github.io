#### About

<div class="small">
I am a PhD student in Computational Mechanics in the research group of [Prof. Schillinger](https://www.ibnm.uni-hannover.de/de/schillinger/) at the Institute of Mechanics and Computational Mechanics (IBNM) at Leibniz University Hannover, Germany. I have a background with M.Sc. in Civil Engineering from the Technical University of Munich. I also hold a B.Sc. in Civil Engineering from University of Applied Science for Engineering and Economics Berlin.

#### My research interest
My reseach interests and focus are on numerical methods such as finite element methods (FEM) in the context of isogeometric analysis (IGA), linear and nonlinear shell analysis including locking phenomena, and immersed finite element methods (immersed IGA, CutFEM). Currently, I am working on isogeometric analysis of Kirchhoff-Love thin shells with the main focus on membrane locking phenomenon. I study the effect of locking and different locking-preventing methodologies via spectral analysis in the context of IGA. Another research topic is a consistent discretization framework of high-order imperfect interface models with the application of isogeometric cut-cell methods. I focus on the stability and robustness of this framework in coporation with researchers from University of Minnesota.
