#### About

<div class="medium">
I am a PhD student in Computational Mechanics in the research group of <a href="https://www.bauing.tu-darmstadt.de/fachbereich_bau_umwelt/ueber_den_fachbereich/professoren____innen_am_fb/professorenliste_details_115392.en.jsp">Prof. Schillinger</a> at the Institute for Mechanics, Computational Mechanics Group at Technical University of Darmstadt, Germany. I have a background with M.Sc. in Civil Engineering from the Technical University of Munich. I also hold a B.Sc. in Civil Engineering from University of Applied Science for Engineering and Economics Berlin.

#### My research interest
My research interests and focus are on numerical methods such as finite element methods (FEM) in the context of isogeometric analysis (IGA), linear and nonlinear shell analysis including locking phenomena, and immersed finite element methods (immersed IGA, CutFEM). Currently, I am working on isogeometric analysis of Kirchhoff-Love thin shells with the main focus on membrane locking phenomenon and explicit dynamics in this context. I study the effect of locking and different locking-preventing methodologies via spectral analysis in the context of IGA, as well as mass lumping scheme for the explicit structural dynamics. Another research topic is a consistent discretization framework of high-order imperfect interface models with the application of isogeometric cut-cell methods. I focus on the stability and robustness of this framework in coporation with researchers from University of Minnesota.
